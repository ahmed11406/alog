Name        : alog1.cpp

Author      : Ahmed Ali

Version     : 1.00

Description : This is an assignment required in java lang in an online course 
from Princton Univ. at Coursera called Algorithms, Part:1. by Dr.Sedgewick and Dr.Kevin Wayne.
However, this project conatins the Weighted Union Find with Path Compression algorithm, and one 
of its scientific applications called the Monte Carlo simulation of 
percolation threshold problem, both implemented in C++ language.  
MANY THANKS to DR. Sedgewick for his great efforts in this online course.
